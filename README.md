Existing technologies used to prevent crimes like identity theft arenâ€™t as effective as they should be, as many of them do not give the owner total control of his data and the information they choose to give out.

Digital Identifier (DIDs) smart contracts built on distributed ledger technologies (decentralized) give individuals total control of their data and allow them to share the content of their data as they please, increasing security and reducing the possibility of data mismanagement or a breach.
